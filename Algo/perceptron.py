#learn_perceptron function: learns from given learning set and returns weights

#use_percepytron functiion: uses learned weights on given test set and returns outputs

#dumb function: returns list of 0 with the length of given test set

#precision function: takes as parameters 2 lists of answers from other models and list of actual answers
#then using formula TP / (TP + FP) returns precision

#recall function: same as precision function but using this formula: TP / (TP + FN)
